Hey guys. Thanks for working on this project!
As usual, every rat/booter/trojan thing has a client which outputs a .exe as a server.
This is it here!
Though the feature itself hasnt been implemented, this is the  code that the client is supposed to output. With changes as user defined in client.
In main.cpp youll see comments detailing how i designed the server.
Its a bit broken, for ex. if the client disconnects, it kills the server. Gotta be fixed. You didn't join this project for nothing right!
Also more functionality has to be added to the server. The only function it servres is to popup message boxes remotely (which can surely scare someone!), but we must add moar!
