Community project: Rat-Like program HF
New? Getting started?
Visit the wikipage: 

https://github.com/HFkeyrat-team/keyrat/wiki/Getting-Started

THere is the keyclient and keyserver
The client is supposed to make a server exe
Since that feature has not been implemented yet, the server.exe is already compiled for you guys to edit the code in. 

We will need to add the source code of the keyserver once it is finished, to the keyclient resources RCDATA? not sure but we have to find a way to make 1 program make a customizeable exe just like how other rats work.

The keyclient interface needs to be added to.
Keyclient features only has email functionality. We need to add more.
Take a day or so to review the code, see how it works, compile it. Learn to use git, get familiar. This project is still VERY primitive. 

Please make a new branch or fork this project to your github account and then work on it.

After a week or so after this project goes live, THEN modifying the master branch will be allowed once we obtain our rythym and workflow.

Communication is very important! So make use of the available features in github, and I may get us and IRC cbox channel to use. Maybe even establish a new forum, but that isnt needed since we can always use HF!


Learn to use git at these youtube videos! I watched all of them and so should you! Learning version control is as important as actual programming itself!
We are all new here (esp. me), if you find any errors, be sure to post it in this repository's issues section and go ahead and fix it!
Do not be afraid to criticise as long as you don't show a bitter attitude towards another member!
